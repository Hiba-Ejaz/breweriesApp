#Brewery Finder App

This is a React-based web application that uses an open-source Brewery API to fetch and display information about various breweries. The app includes functionality to search for breweries by name and view their details.

Functionality
This application utilizes various technologies and techniques to provide the desired functionality:

React Router: Used to enable client-side routing and provide seamless navigation between different pages in the app.

Higher-Order Component (HOC): Created to handle data fetching from the API, which is then passed down to other components as props.

Debouncing: Implemented to avoid excessive API calls during user input in the search bar.

Material UI: Used for styling and creating a more interactive user interface.
